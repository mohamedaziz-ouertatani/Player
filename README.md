# Player
My task and individual work in a collaborative project which is a video game, and my task was to script code to create a the player (main character of the game). 

How to run the code?.. 
Follow me!
Firstly, you should be using a Linux distrobution. After downloading the files, open the terminal in the same directory in which you downloaded the files and run "make" then run "./prog". Enjoy!!!
